# fuelcalculator

*Project by Timon Carstens*


This is a private project where I created a fuel calculator which can help you in your Sim Racing career. Because it is boring only to use it for my own, I published it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Feverest-org/fuelcalculator) and share it with you and your friend.

## How to use it:

The fuelcalculator is easy to use. Just open the [fuelcalculator](https://fuelcalculator.feverest.de) and use the input fields to enter your race data. 
### Race Duration
For the <u>Race Duration</u> you could either enter the duration of your race in the hours-field, the minutes-field or both if you want to make a race for example 1h 30min.  
### Lap Time
For the <u>Lap Time</u> you need to enter the information of your best Lap Time in the format of MM.ss (you can also use the comma (MM,ss) as a separator). It is important to notice that the separator is necessary. If the input is only a single number, it will be detected as seconds. For example: 
> input <code>2</code>; output <code>0 min, 2 sec</code>  
> input: <code>2.0</code>; output: <code>2 min, 0 sec</code>
### Lap Consumption
For the <u>Lap Consumption</u> you need to enter your average fuel consumption for one lap. You can write the number with or without a separator. If you have precise information, which I would recommend, you can use the dot or the comma as separator for your number.
### Fuel Consumption
The <u>Fuel Consumption</u> is your result field. You don't have to write anything here. With every keyboard input in one of the input-fields, the fuel consumption will be updated.  
The result is a save fuel consumption, which you will need to fulfil your race with the minimum amount of fuel.
